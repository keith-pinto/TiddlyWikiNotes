title: Pythagorean Theorem - Proof by squares
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[img[Pythagorean theorem Image #1]]

There are many proofs of this theorem, but the following is probably simÂ­pler than most.<br/>
Let the legs be a and b and the hypotenuse c, and arrange four replicas of the triangle in the corners of a square of side a + b, as shown above.<br/>

Then the area of the large square equals 4 times the area of the triangle plus the area of the small square; that is

$$
(a+b)^{2} = 4(\frac{1}{2}ab) + c^{2}
$$

This simplifies at once to $$a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$$, which is the ''Pythagorean theorem''.
