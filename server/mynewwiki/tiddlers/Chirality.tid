title: Chirality
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Chirality is a geometric property of some molecules and ions. A chiral molecule / ion is non-superposable on its mirror image. The presence of an asymmetric carbon center is one of several structural features that induce chirality in organic and inorganic molecules.

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called enantiomers or //''optical isomers''//. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either right-handed or left-handed. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the stereochemistry in organic and inorganic chemistry. The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.
