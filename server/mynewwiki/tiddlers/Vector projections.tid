Projection of $${\overrightharpoon{y}}$$ over $${\overrightharpoon{x}}$$:

$$\LARGE

Proj_{\overrightharpoon{y}}{\overrightharpoon{x}} =
\Bigg( \frac{\overrightharpoon{x}.\overrightharpoon{y}}{||y||^2} \Bigg)

\overrightharpoon{y}

$$

Project of a vector over another is synonymous to the shadow of a vector falling onto another vector.
