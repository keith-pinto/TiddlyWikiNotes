''Mean:'' The "average" number; found by adding all data points and dividing by the number of data points.

''Median:'' The middle number; found by ordering all data points and picking out the one in the middle (or if there are two middle numbers, taking the mean of those two numbers). 

''Mode:'' The most frequent numberâ€”that is, the number that occurs the highest number of times.
